Turnstyl is an NPM package built to work with Kafka to allow you to compare the data schema input at the producer level to what arrives into your data warehouse.

The aim of Turnstyl is to monitor and notify the user of data validity issues in your data pipeline, specifically at the fringe between backend and ETL systems. Turnstyl was primarily designed for use in micro-service architecture where events are dumped into a data warehouse in a generic and schema-agnostic format.
